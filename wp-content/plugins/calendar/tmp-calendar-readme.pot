msgid "This is intentional. Many people requested that they wanted users other than admin to be able to manage events and this is what this feature allows. You must of course trust the group of users you grant access to do sensible things. If they are not doing sensible things, you might want to review their ability to access the manage events screen by changing the user group that can do this."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "This is normal. It was reasoned during development that because events are usually useful to everyone, the deletion of a user doesn't mean that you necessarily want events they added to be deleted also. Because events now have to be associated with a user, deleting a user who added events causes their events to be allocated to the admin user. If you don't want these events anymore then you have to manually delete them. You might find it easier to do this while the user is still active because you will be able to see their events more clearly on the manage events screen."

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Sadly for those that liked the links but don't know how to re-enable them you are out of luck. I don't code this plugin for profit and so I had to think of the time I was spending on support questions rather than features in this particular case. I like pretty links and use them on all my sites, but they are non-trivial to setup and I don't want to be giving lessons every day on what to do rather than getting on with my own work. Sorry."

msgid "When you install Calendar you will note that there exists one category, entitled \"General\" into which all new events are placed. If you enable categories you will notice that events suddenly show up highlighted in the same colour that the \"General\" category is set to and that a key denoting the name of the category and its colour shows up below the calendar. This means that if you create a new category with a different name and colour and place event(s) into it they will show up in the new colour. This allows you to see easily what type of events are scheduled."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Since the introduction of categories each event must be placed in a category. For this reason you are prevented from deleting the \"General\" event category so that events always have at least one category in which to sit. You can however change the name and colour of the \"General\" category to suit your site or turn off categories completely. Note that turning off categories will not prevent the display of the category in which an event sits in the admin panel, it will merely obliterate all references to categories on public instances of Calendar."

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Yes. You simply need to fill in the full URL (including the http:// bit) in the field entitled \"Event Link (Optional)\". This will then turn the event title into a link to the URL of your choice. Leaving this field blank will disable the feature for the event."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "This is mainly for people who are upgrading. Because there is only one category by default, enabling them immediately upon upgrade would result in upgraders suddenly seeing all their events (perhaps hundreds or even thousands) listed under the same type, which would look a bit silly. Disabling it by default allows non-interested parties to keep using Calendar the way they have and interested parties to put events in the right categories before enabling the category system."
